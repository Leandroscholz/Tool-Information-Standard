# Tool Information Standard

An information standard for software description that defines attributes that must be defined within a 5-tier scale of description completeness and quality. It is based on [biotoolsSchema](https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsSchema) and the [EDAM ontology](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology). The standard is being adopted by [bio.tools](https://bio.tools) - the Tools and Data Services Registry of the [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) Research Infrastructure.

You can read about the standard [here](https://bio-tools.github.io/Tool-Information-Standard/).
