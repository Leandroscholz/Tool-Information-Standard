# bio.tools

The "SPARSE" tier defines the minimum information requirement for new bio.tools entries.  It is [under discussion](https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsRegistry/issues/338) to allow a user to filter entries according to tiers in the standard.  The standard also provides a basis to monitor bio.tools content and label entries in various ways:

* *entry completeness* ("SPARSE" through to "COMPREHENSIVE")
* whether an entry was manually inspected
* whether an entry is verified, *i.e.* conforms to the Curation Guidelines
* overall *entry quality* ("NEEDS TO IMPROVE" through to "EXCELLENT") - conflating the notions above

If and how to use such labels is currently [under discussion](https://github.com/bio-tools/Tool-Information-Standard/issues/1).
