# bio.tools

The corpus of [bio.tools](https://bio.tools) content is being improved progressively according to tiers in the standard, the aim in the first instance being to bring all entries up to at least "DETAILED" standard.

The "SPARSE" tier (name, description, homepage, unique ID) defines the minimum information requirement for new bio.tools entries.  It is [under discussion](https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsRegistry/issues/338) to allow a user to filter entries according to tiers in the standard.

The standard also provides a basis to monitor bio.tools content and label entries in various ways:

* *entry completeness* ("SPARSE" through to "COMPREHENSIVE")
* whether an entry was manually inspected (by entry author, official bio.tools curator, or someone else)
* whether an entry is verified, *i.e.* conforms to the bio.tools [Curation Guidelines](http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html)
* overall *entry quality* ("NEEDS TO IMPROVE" through to "EXCELLENT") - conflating the notions above

If and how to use such labels is currently [under discussion](https://github.com/bio-tools/Tool-Information-Standard/issues/1).
