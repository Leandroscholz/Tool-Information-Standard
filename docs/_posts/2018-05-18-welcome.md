Welcome!  This site describes an information standard for the desription of bioinformatics software tools. The standard defines the attributes that must be defined within a 5-tier scale of entry completeness and quality.  It is based on biotoolsSchema [^1] - a formalised XML schema (XSD) which provides a rigorous syntax for basic tool attributes, and the EDAM ontology [^2] which provides rigorous semantics for the scientific description of tools.  The standard is being adopted by bio.tools - the ELIXIR Tools and Data Services Registry [^3].
