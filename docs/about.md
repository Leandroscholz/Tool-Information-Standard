An **information standard** for the desription of bioinformatics software tools, that lists software attributes that must be specified within a 5-tier scale of description completeness and quality.  It is based on [biotoolsSchema](https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema) and the [EDAM ontology](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology). The standard is being adopted by [bio.tools](https://bio.tools) - the ELIXIR Tools and Data Services Registry.

- [Broadly applicable to diverse types of tool](#tooltypes) including application software, workflows and APIs. 
- Uses software attributes defined in [biotoolsSchema](https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema)
- Makes heavy use of controlled vocabularies including the [EDAM ontology](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology) for types of data, data formats, operations and common topics.
- It is an [open community-driven project](#community)
